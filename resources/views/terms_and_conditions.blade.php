                        transfer of Products outside of the continental United States. Customer acknowledges that the
                        exportation of Products is subject to compliance under the United States Export Control
                        Administration Act of 1979 and the Export Administration Act of 1985, as they may be amended
                        from time to time, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the
                        "Act"). If Customer exports the Products, Customer agrees to comply with the terms and
                        restrictions of the Act, along with any antiboycott laws and regulations related to the
                        Products. Customer confirms that it will not unlawfully export or re-export the Products,
                        directly or indirectly, to (i) any countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions or
                        (ii) any end user who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export transactions by any
                        agency of the U.S. government. Customer warrants that the Products will not be used to develop
                        or produce weapons of mass destruction or sold to an end user who, Customer knows or has reason
                        to know, may utilize the Products directly or indirectly in connection with weapons of mass
                        destruction or nuclear activities listed in U.S. EAR 778.3(b)(1), (2) & (3), whether or not the
                        item is specifically designed or modified for such activities. If Customer is not the ultimate
                        end user, Customer agrees to screen the reliability of each end user so that the Products will
                        not be used in a manner which is prohibited. Upon our request, Customer agrees to execute,
                        acknowledge, deliver and to cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents
                        and take actions as we may from time to time reasonably request to assure that the necessary
                        export requirements have been met. If required, Customer will obtain prior authorization for
                        export of the Products in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations of the
                        Department of Commerce. If applicable, Customer will be responsible for assuring that the
                        appropriate import permits and licenses with respect to the Products, including any markings
                        needed for import are obtained. Customer shall indemnify and hold DFS harmless against any
                        claims, damages or losses incurred as a result of Customer's failure to comply with the Act or
                        terms contained herein. DFS reserves the right to terminate any sale if Customer fails to comply
                        with the Act or the terms contained herein.

                        licensor(s). Any rights that Customer may have with respect to the software shall arise only
                        pursuant to license agreements ("Licenses") between Customer and the licensor(s), which Licenses
                        may be contained within the packaging associated with the Products. Customer agrees to use all

                    <p><strong>16</strong>Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be illegal, invalid or
                        unenforceable to any extent under applicable law, such provision shall be fully severable. The

                <li>
                    <p><strong>17</strong>Arbitration. Either party to this Agreement may choose to have any dispute,
                        claim or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement resolved by binding arbitration
                        pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. If such
                        rules conflict with this arbitration agreement section, however, then the terms of this
                        arbitration agreement section shall control. This arbitration agreement between Customer and DFS
                        is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the
                        Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. Judgment upon the award rendered may be
                        entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any arbitration award in excess of $100,000 made
                        pursuant to this arbitration agreement section may be appealed by the party against which the
                        award is made. Such appeal will be a de novo arbitration proceeding before three arbitrators.
                        The parties agree and understand that (i) they may choose arbitration instead of litigation to
                        resolve disputes, (ii) all disputes arising under case law, statutory law, and all other laws
                        including, but not limited to, all contract, tort, and property disputes, may be subject to
                        binding arbitration in accord with this Agreement and (iii) the arbitrator shall have all powers
                        provided by law and this Agreement, except for powers limited or prohibited by this Agreement.
                        The arbitrator shall not have any authority however, to award damages or penalties in
                        contravention to the provisions of this Agreement. No class action or request for relief may be
                        brought under this arbitration agreement. Customer agrees that it shall not have the right to
                        participate in arbitration or in court proceedings as a representative or a member of any class
                        of claimants pertaining to any claim arising from or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
                        anything herein to the contrary, we retain an option to use judicial or non-judicial relief to
                        recover the Products or to enforce our security interest in the Products, to enforce the
                        monetary obligation secured by the Products or to foreclose on the Products. Such judicial
                        relief would take the form of a lawsuit. The institution and maintenance of any action for
                        judicial relief in a court to foreclose upon any Products, to obtain a monetary judgment or to
                        enforce this Agreement, shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party to compel
                        arbitration regarding any other dispute or remedy subject to arbitration in this Agreement,
                        including the filing of a counterclaim in a suit brought by DFS pursuant to this
                        provision.CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT IN ARBITRATION: YOU GIVE UP RIGHTS TO SEEK
                        REMEDIES IN COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL; YOUR ABILITY TO COMPEL OTHER PARTIES TO
                        PRODUCE DOCUMENTS OR BE EXAMINED IS MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT; AND, YOUR RIGHTS TO APPEAL
                        OR CHANGE ANY ARBITRATION AWARD IN ANY COURT ARE STRICTLY LIMITED.
